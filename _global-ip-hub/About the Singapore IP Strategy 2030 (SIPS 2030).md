<p>The Singapore IP Strategy 2030 (SIPS 2030) is the national strategy to
strengthen Singapore’s IA/IP (intangible asset / intellectual property)
regime, enable enterprises to use their IA/IP more effectively, and create
good job opportunities for Singaporeans.</p>
<p>Global IA value stood at more than US$61 trillion in 2023, far surpassing
that of tangible assets, and is predicted to continue rising. As the IA
and IP continues to rise in prominence as drivers of economic growth, enterprises
and innovators need to be equipped with the tools and know-how to manage
their IA/IP effectively for growth.</p>

effects on product development, go-to-market decisions, and strategic partnerships.
As we support our local companies to build innovative capabilities to move
up the value chain, capture new growth opportunities and attract more IA/IP
intensive companies to Singapore, we will raise awareness of the value
of IA/IP, and nurture IA/IP skills across the board.”</p>

<p>Since the 2013 IP Hub Master Plan, Singapore has journeyed on to become
Asia’s leading centre for innovation and IP. Now, Singapore has the opportunity
to build on our firm foundations as a legal, financial, and modern services
hub and leverage IA/IP to fuel the next bound of value creation and growth.</p>
<p>The 10-year blueprint aims to contribute to Singapore’s position as a
global-Asia node of technology, innovation, and enterprise, and support
our wider Research Innovation Enterprise (RIE) objectives.</p>
<p>SIPS 2030 consists of <strong>three main thrusts</strong>, each addressing
a different aspect of Singapore’s economy – i.e., supporting international
activities (<strong><u>Hub</u></strong>), growing local enterprises (<strong><u>Business</u></strong>),
and building a high-calibre workforce (<strong><u>Jobs</u></strong>).</p>

<p>SIPS 2030 is a Whole-of-Government effort led by the Ministry of Law,
Ministry of Trade and Industry, Ministry of Finance, and IPOS, with support
from various other agencies.</p>
<p>The successful implementation of SIPS 2030 requires the collective efforts
and energy of all stakeholders, and we welcome feedback and contributions.
Let us work together to realise a brighter, IA/IP-driven, future for Singapore.</p>
