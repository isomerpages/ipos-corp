<h4><strong>Strengthen Singapore’s Position as a Global Hub for IA/IP</strong></h4>
<p>A world-class IA/IP regime is critical for an innovative economy and forms
the foundation for SIPS 2030. Innovators and creators need to be able to
effectively protect their IP rights, in order to secure their competitive
advantage in the marketplace and confidently make investments in R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Over the years, IP cooperation amongst ASEAN member states has also steadily
grown, increasing the attractiveness of the region as an integrated economic
bloc. Singapore can be a node that facilitates greater interoperability
of IP systems in the region, as well as strengthens the connectivity between
ASEAN and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Singapore will also continue efforts to position ourselves as a choice
location for international IP dispute resolution by augmenting the pipeline
of local experts in areas such as alternative dispute resolution.</p>
