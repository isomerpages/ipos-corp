<p>The IP Hub Master Plan and its Update provides a strong base for Singapore
to build capabilities and infrastructure to support a wide range of IP
activities. The Singapore IP Strategy 2030 (SIPS 2030) aims to elevate
Singapore’s standing as a leader in intangible assets (IA) and IP expertise
and services. Read more for an overview of our milestones.</p>

<p><strong>Trailblazing with a new Intangibles Disclosure Framework (IDF)</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A new framework was announced by IPOS and the Accounting and Corporate
Regulatory Authority (ACRA), to disclose and communicate the value of intangible
assets (IA). Among the first of its kind in the world, the IDF provides
a systematic and consistent way to disclose and communicate IA such as
brand value, patents or registered designs. Enterprises were also encouraged
to disclose IA beyond those recognised under the accounting standards (e.g.,
human capital and/or internally generated intangibles) under the voluntary
framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The IDF is part of the Singapore IP Strategy 2030 and a key step to help
enterprises commercialise their IA. Improved IA disclosures can lead to
better investment decisions, increased market competitiveness, and a strengthened
global IP and business hub.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Singapore hosts INTA’s Annual Meeting for the first time</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>This global conference highlighted Singapore’s position as Asia’s brand
and business hub. Over 8,000 global thought and business leaders convened
in Singapore to discuss the latest brand and IP strategies at the International
Trademark Association’s (INTA) annual global conference in May 2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conference featured a ‘Singapore Pavilion’, which showcased more than
20 global and local enterprises that leveraged Singapore’s position as
a global brand, business, and IP hub for growth. They tapped on the city
state’s business friendly environment, skilled labour market, robust physical
and digital infrastructure, ASEAN connection and strong legal and IP regime
for global expansion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The showcase was curated by Intellectual Property Office of Singapore
(IPOS), the Economic Development Board (EDB), Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG)
and Singapore Tourism Board (STB).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Funding to help ASEAN businesses resolve Tech &amp; IP disputes</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>With the global increase in IP or technology disputes, IPOS and the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) announced the WIPO-Singapore
ASEAN Mediation Programme (AMP) to provide individuals or entities with
subsidised mediation for their IP or technology disputes. AMP provides
funding of up to SGD 8,000 for disputes or commercial contract negotiations
involving at least one ASEAN party which are mediated at the WIPO Center.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first mediation success was then seen a few months after. The settlement
agreement was reached within a day, which translated into significant cost
and time savings for all parties as compared to traditional litigation
that would have taken one to two years.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>2022</strong></h4>
<p><strong>International Valuation Standards Council (IVSC) launched Asia Office in Singapore</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Global valuation standards setter, IVSC, picked Singapore as its first
base outside Europe, and marked a new milestone in Singapore’s growth as
an Intangible Assets hub and Asia’s growing global role in the valuation
profession. As trusted IA valuation guidelines are important enablers of
IA transactions and monetisation, the strong partnership between Singapore
and IVSC will catalyse the growth of the valuation industry in Singapore
to support innovation and business growth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Young innovators and entrepreneurs supported with more resources</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Start-ups, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and youth were the targets
of more resources announced at IP Week @ SG 2022. Innovators would be able
to tap on free IP legal advice, patent drafting and/or prosecution services,
resources, and training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Trade Secrets guide was released to help enterprises better understand,
protect and manage their trade secrets. Case studies and a list of available
trade secrets tools was included in the guide, which was jointly developed
by IPOS, Action Community for Entrepreneurship, International Enterprise
Singapore, Singapore Business Federation, Singapore Fintech Association
and SGTech.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Updated programmes to help more enterprises protect IP</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>With the rising volume of IP filings, IPOS streamlined its acceleration
programmes to give more enterprises a competitive edge as global economies
reopen. The SG IP FAST programme was extended to April 2024 with a doubled
annual cap of 120 patent applications while the 12 Months File-to-Grant
programme ceased, enabling more enterprises to receive their patent in
as fast as 6 months or 9 months with SG IP FAST.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to accelerated IP protection, businesses were also given more
support to resolve IP disputes in Singapore with the Revised Enhanced Mediation
Promotion Scheme (REMPS). Enterprises could tap on an increased funding
quantum for disputes involving both Singapore and foreign IP rights.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>2021</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Launch of Singapore IP Strategy 2030 (SIPS 2030)</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The 10-year blueprint was designed to strengthen Singapore’s IA/IP (intangible
asset / intellectual property) regime and position as a global IA/IP hub,
enable enterprises to use their IA/IP more effectively, and create good
job opportunities for Singaporeans. The Singapore IP Strategy 2030 is a
Whole-of-Government effort led by the Ministry of Law, Ministry of Trade
and Industry, Ministry of Finance, and IPOS, with support from various
other agencies. Find out more about the Singapore IP Strategy 2030 (SIPS
2030) <strong>here</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Enhancing Singapore’s IP regime with a new Copyright Act</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The new Copyright Act, which came into force on 21 November 2021, enhances
our copyright regime with updated provisions to strengthen the rights of
creators and performers, and factor in technological developments that
have impacted how content is created, distributed, accessed and used.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New IP resources unveiled at IP Week</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The 10th edition of IP Week @ SG returned for the first time since the
pandemic, and welcomed international stakeholders, including Mr Daren Tang,
Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO),
heads of global IP offices and leading industry players to share insights
